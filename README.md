# AI-Based Mentorship System with Behavioral Analysis

## 🚀 Overview
The AI-Based Mentorship System is an intelligent learning platform designed to help engineering students improve their problem-solving skills.

Unlike traditional assessment systems that only evaluate correct or incorrect answers, this system analyzes **how students think** while solving problems. It tracks behavioral indicators such as hesitation time, retries, skipped questions, and confidence levels to identify root conceptual gaps.

The system then provides **personalized AI mentor insights, learning paths, and targeted recommendations** to improve student understanding and industry readiness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Engineering students often have undetected problem-solving gaps due to generic assessments and limited mentorship.  
Traditional platforms focus only on answers, not thinking behavior, which leads to poor skill development and low industry readiness.
